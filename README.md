# ApnaKhata

A premium B2B ledger, billing, and intelligent inventory ecosystem for the Indian MSME
supply chain — connecting **Distributors** (wholesalers) and **Shop Owners** (kirana /
retailers) on a single, bank-grade financial rail.

## What lives where

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Full technical specification: system architecture, settlement engine, webhook gateway, ML forecasting design, credit passport, UI design system. |
| `database/schema.sql` | PostgreSQL DDL — users, inventory, transactions ledger, payment allocations (FIFO settlement), credit score metrics, stock movement time-series. |
| `services/forecasting/forecast.py` | FastAPI + Prophet stock-forecasting microservice (Indian festival seasonality, safety-stock index, reorder recommendations). |
| `services/forecasting/requirements.txt` | Python dependencies for the forecasting service. |
| `backend/src/services/CreditScoreEvaluator.ts` | Weighted credit scoring engine (300–900) with risk-tier classification, backed by the transactions ledger. |
| `mobile/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` | React Native + TypeScript + NativeWind dashboard — credit score widget, cash-flow balances, forecast-driven stock alerts. |

## Core pillars

1. **Dual-sided digital khata** — real-time procurement + retail ledgers with an
   automated FIFO settlement engine and transactional SMS/WhatsApp notifications.
2. **Billing & POS integration** — ESC/POS thermal printing and a secured webhook
   gateway for Tally / Vyapar / Marg ERP ingestion.
3. **ML stock forecasting** — Prophet-based 90-day rolling demand model tuned for
   Indian retail seasonality (Diwali, Holi, wedding seasons).
4. **Bank-ready credit evaluation** — a transparent 300–900 score computed from actual
   ledger behavior, exportable as a cryptographically signed "ApnaKhata Credit Risk
   Passport" PDF for lender API integration.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the complete blueprint.
